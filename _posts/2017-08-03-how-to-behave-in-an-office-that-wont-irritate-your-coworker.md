* Discuss how it's not ok to double dip, then proceed to double dip and claim everyone said it was OK
* Open all the individually packed plastic wear sets because you want everyone to have they're own knife.
* When a coworker brings a dog into the office, treat said dog in a way that would be disconcerting if that dog were a human being.
* Berate your coworkers for putting guacamole on a burrito because it is gross while squeezing every last drop of ketchup out of a packet onto your burrito.
* Have an obsession with young boys who carry rings down the aisle during a wedding.
* Eat only cheese pizza, and act pretentious about the state of burnt cheese on top.
