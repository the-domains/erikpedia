* Discuss how it's not ok to double dip, then proceed to double dip and claim everyone said it was OK
* Open all the individually packed plastic wear sets because you want everyone to have their own knife.
* When a coworker brings a dog into the office, treat said dog in a way that would be disconcerting if that dog were a human being.
* Berate your coworkers for putting guacamole on a burrito because it is gross while squeezing every last drop of ketchup out of a packet onto your burrito.
* Have an obsession with young boys who carry rings down the aisle during a wedding.
* Eat only cheese pizza, and act pretentious about the state of burnt cheese on top.
* Bring melted chocolates to the office.
* Be offended when offered ranch dressing to dip your onion rings into.
* Parade around the office with half chewed banana chunks on a white paper napkin and set said napkin on the communal kitchen table. Proceed to discuss how a fellow office mate will enjoy eating these leftovers.
* Throw plastic eating utensils at your coworkers. It inspires friendly competition.
