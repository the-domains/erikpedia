Fact, salt has no proven direct negative side effects. Eat all the salt you please, that is until your heart stops, or you die of scurvy. But I can assure you it will not raise your blood pressure.

I can say though, bloating is not a negative side effect, or at least it isn't a lasting negative effect.
