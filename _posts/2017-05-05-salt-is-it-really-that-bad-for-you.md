# Salt, is it really that bad for you?

Fact, salt has no proven direct negative side effects. Eat all the salt you please, that is until your heart stops, or you die of scurvy. But I can assure you it will not raise your blood pressure. 

I can say though, bloating is not a negative side effect, or at least it isn't a lasting negative effect.
