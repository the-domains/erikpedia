Do you live in a warm climate? Perhaps near the beach. Are you constantly refilling your window wiper fluid spending tens of dollars on fluid every couple months? Are you irritated by visiting the auto parts store every time you need to top up this blue mystery juice? Well I've got the solution for you. Every mechanic hates this trick.

Water.

Maybe add some windex (For even more cost savings, use the generic blue juice from any general store)

That's really it. Unless you live somewhere that experiences below freezing temperatures, you do not need to worry about buying the correct fluid. In geographic locations that don't freeze, the stores don't even sell the anti-freeze type.

Start by adding a few splashes of windex to the reservoir tank depending on how dirty your windows get and then fill the rest up with simple tap water. You can use distilled water or filtered water if you live somewhere with unusually hard water to avoid calcium buildup on the sprayers.

That's it, no more trips to the auto parts store with dirty windows, or an unnecessary trip to the gas station just to clean your windows.
