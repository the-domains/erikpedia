Beer curls. Ideally you will use two beers, and they will be a minimum of 24oz. The larger the better, because that means more weight, and bigger gains. No other exercise can promise the same level of gains with this much enjoyment. You will see instant results with this fast, easy, and fun workout. See proof as the cans get lighter in as little as one curl.

Technique can vary depending on how many beers you have, and if they are in cans or a glass, but as long as you are lifting the glass, from approximately waist height, to your mouth, you are preforming this exercise properly.

1. Begin by sitting up straight or standing. It is important to have correct posture throughout each curl.
2. Firmly grasp each beer, but make sure you don't crush the can. That can wait until the last curl.
3. Engage your core as you lift each arm, one at a time to your mouth. (If you are standing, you can also engage your glutes.)
4. Throw your head back and take a drink of beer.
5. Rinse and repeat until you have finished each beer. Feel free to complete as many sets as you can.

Congrats you have completed a well balanced full body workout. Keep up the good work, you'll be packing on those gains in no time.
