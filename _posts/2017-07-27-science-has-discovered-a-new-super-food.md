You'll never guess what it is. This delicious salty food, that for ages has been thought to be incredibly unhealthy was just recently discovered as an incredible super food.

You guessed right, bacon. Bacon has incredible health benefits! Don't believe me? Feel free to Google it. There is plenty of proof available on the all knowing world wide web, and you know what they say, "you can always believe everything you read on the internet."

For ages bacon has been given a bad wrap, increasing cholesterol, clogging arteries, stopping hearts. No more! Those myths have been debunked! Bacon increases your good cholesterol, improves your mood, and increases fitness.

What are you waiting for? Go eat some bacon! I have already had 12 slices today.
